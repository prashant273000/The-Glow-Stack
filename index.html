                    <p class="p-sub">Drowning in complex lectures, unstructured documentation, and fear of asking seniors for help.</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Let’s be real—staying 100% focused during long lectures is impossible. Students zone out, miss key points, and when exam time hits, there’s a scramble for notes that often don’t exist because everyone was in the same boat.</li>
                        <li>Most of the times it’s not just about learning to code; it’s about knowing where to start. Most students struggle to build logic or find a clear roadmap, ending up confused by the endless amount of tutorials online.</li>
                        <li>Freshers are often too intimidated to approach seniors. They desperately need advice on what to study (and what to skip), but the fear of judgment or rejection keeps them from asking for help.</li>

                    <p class="p-sub">Zero confidence in interviews due to lack of grooming, poor posture, and health neglect.</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>The Grooming Gap:</strong> Many students spend four years in a casual campus bubble. When faced with a corporate interview, the lack of personal grooming makes them feel like they're wearing a "costume" rather than a professional outfit, leading to a massive drop in self-assurance.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Coder’s Posture:</strong> Years of being hunched over a laptop results in "Tech Neck" and closed-off body language. This subconsciously signals low energy to recruiters, often overshadowing high technical skills.</li>
                        <li><strong>Health Neglect:</strong> Ignoring basic health and skincare isn't just about looks—it’s about the mental edge. If you don't feel good when you look in the mirror, it is nearly impossible to project the confidence required to nail a high-pressure interview.</li>
